Here are some cool quotes from some random movies :
1. "Find a truly original idea. It is the only way I will ever distinguish myself. It is the only way I will ever matter."
-A Beautiful Mind

2. "You don’t have to be the bad guy. You are the most talented, most interesting, and most extraordinary person in the universe. And you are capable of amazing things. Because you are the Special. And so am I.
And so is everyone. The prophecy is made up, but it’s also true. It’s about all of us. Right now, it’s about you. And you... still... can change everything."
-The Lego Movie

3. "Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine." -The Imitation Game

4. "There should be no boundaries to human endeavor. We are all different. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there’s life, there is hope."
-The Theory of Everything

5. "Just because someone stumbles and loses their path, doesn’t mean they’re lost forever."
-X-Men Days of Future Past

6. "Where we’re going we don’t need roads"
-Back to the futur

7. "I’m bad, and that’s good. I will never be good, and that’s not bad. There’s no one I’d rather be then me."
-Wreck-it Ralph

8. "KA-ME-HA-ME-HAAAAAAAAAA"
-Various movies

Movie culture won’t help for this project even if it’s important.
